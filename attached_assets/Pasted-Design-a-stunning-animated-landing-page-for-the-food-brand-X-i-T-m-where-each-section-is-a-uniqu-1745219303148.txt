Design a stunning, animated landing page for the food brand "XÃ´i Táº¥m", where each section is a unique animation module that tells a story and captivates the viewer.
The site should be full of imaginative, impressive animation effects â€“ blending subtle micro-interactions with bold transitions that surprise and delight.

ðŸŽ¨ Main color palette: green tea (xanh cá»‘m) & soft purple (tÃ­m nháº¡t).
ðŸ”‡ No pricing, no order/contact info â€“ just visual storytelling to showcase the beauty and soul of the food.

ðŸ’¥ Animation Concepts Per Section:

Hero Section â€“

Floating glutinous rice grains slowly come together to form the "XÃ´i Táº¥m" logo using particle morphing animation. Soft, ambient movement of clouds or steam in the background creates a dreamy entrance.

Menu Overview â€“

Use a scroll-based split reveal: the screen splits diagonally as the viewer scrolls, revealing two glowing categories: "XÃ´i" and "Rau cÃ¢u", each with slight neon shimmer and parallax depth.

XÃ´i Section â€“

Each dish appears with a claymation-style pop-up animation, where sticky rice seems to "grow" naturally on-screen. Add a bouncing hover effect, and background uses looped cooking pot steam animation for ambiance.

Rau CÃ¢u Section â€“

Use glass morphism and floating bubble physics to present each jelly dish. When hovered, jelly jiggles slightly with a soundless "wobble" animation. Add background sparkles using canvas or WebGL.

Behind the Scenes Section â€“

A horizontal scrolling timeline with animated illustrations showing the food-making process. Use hand-drawn sketch animation that transitions to real food photos as the user scrolls.

Closing Section â€“

A poetic closing module using kinetic typography animation with a Vietnamese proverb about food, overlaid on a slow-zoom background video of steaming xÃ´i or a peaceful kitchen in the early morning.

ðŸ’¡ Extra Touches:

Add soundless ambient motion like falling rice grains, floating herbs, or light mist for depth.

Use GSAP / Lottie / Three.js for complex animations like morphing or physics-based effects.

Transitions between modules should feel like scenes in a short film â€” smooth and immersive.
